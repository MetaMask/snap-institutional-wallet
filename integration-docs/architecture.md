# Overview

The institutional snap is a preinstalled component of MetaMask that allows users to interact with decentralised applications across EVMs and propose transactions to custodians as if the keys were stored in the extension. It is a thin client that runs in the browser and communicates directly with a custodian service to initiate transactions and message signing.

Custodians are responsible for account management abd transaction/message signing, including being ultimately accountable for nonce and gas parameters. They are also responsible for providing the user with a way to authenticate with the extension.
